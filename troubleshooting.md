Troubleshooting a system where an application won't start involves several steps:

1. **Check Logs**:
    - Look at the application logs and system logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` on Linux) for any error messages.
2. **Resource Availability**:
    - Verify if there are sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) using tools like `top`, `htop`, or `df`.
3. **Permissions**:
    - Ensure the application has the necessary permissions to run. Check file and directory permissions.
4. **Dependencies**:
    - Confirm all required dependencies are installed. Check for missing libraries or services.
5. **Network Issues**:
    - If the application requires network access, verify network connectivity and DNS resolution with tools like `ping` or `nslookup`.
6. **Configuration Files**:
    - Review the applicationâ€™s configuration files for any errors or misconfigurations.
7. **Service Status**:
    - Use `systemctl` or `service` commands to check if the application service is running or has failed.
8. **Firewall/Security**:
    - Check firewall settings to ensure necessary ports are open. Review SELinux or AppArmor logs if applicable.
9. **Application Errors**:
    - Run the application in debug mode if available to get more detailed error information.
10. **Consult Documentation**:
    - Review application documentation or support forums for common issues and solutions.
