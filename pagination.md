In the context of operating systems like Linux, "pagination" typically refers to a memory management technique known as virtual memory paging. Here’s a breakdown of what it involves:

1. **Virtual Memory**: It's a memory management capability where the OS uses both hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage.
2. **Paging**: This is a specific method within virtual memory management. It divides a program's memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. These pages are stored in a page table, which maps virtual addresses used by the program to physical addresses in RAM or to disk storage (swap space) when they are not actively being used.
3. **Page Faults**: When a program attempts to access a memory location that is not currently in RAM (but might be stored on disk), a page fault occurs. The operating system then brings the required page into RAM from disk (if it’s not already there) and updates the page table accordingly.
4. **Benefits**: Paging allows the operating system to efficiently manage memory, allowing more applications to run simultaneously than can fit in physical memory alone. It also enables features like memory protection and efficient memory allocation.

In essence, pagination in Linux (or any modern operating system) is a critical mechanism that enables efficient memory usage and multitasking by dynamically managing the allocation of physical memory and disk space to processes as needed.
